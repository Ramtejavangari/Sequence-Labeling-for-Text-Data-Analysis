# Sequence Labeling for Text Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on implementing sequence labeling techniques for analyzing text data. Sequence labeling is a fundamental task in natural language processing (NLP) used for identifying and categorizing sequences of tokens in textual datasets. The framework is designed to support tasks such as:

- Named Entity Recognition (NER)
- Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging
- Chunking and other sequence-based text analysis tasks

The project utilizes structured methodologies for processing and analyzing linguistic patterns effectively.

## Features
- **Comprehensive Template**: Pre-defined structure to simplify sequence labeling tasks.
- **Customizable Framework**: Easily adapt the solution to different sequence labeling tasks.
- **Efficient Analysis**: Streamlined data input, processing, and result visualization.
